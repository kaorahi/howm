-------------------------------------
[Schedule, Todo] -- @schedule, !deadline (until %sdays days from now)
!deadline, +todo, -reminder, ~defer (top %tnum entries)
%reminder
-------------------------------------
Recent
%recent
-------------------------------------
Random -- If you do not like this, [Edit Menu] to erase it.
%random
-------------------------------------

Format of schedule and todo (Please replace {} with []):
{2002-10-21}@1  schedule -- (shown in schedule part. @3 = "3 days schedule to 10-23")
{2002-10-21}+7  todo -- float up slowly from the date in 7 days
{2002-10-21}!7  deadline -- float up fast from 7 days before the date
{2002-10-21}-1  reminder -- float at the date and sink slowly one unit per 1 day
{2002-10-21}~30 defer -- float at the date and repeat sinking and floating with 30 days period
{2002-10-21}.   done -- sink forever
(Numbers after marks are default values.)

How to remember:
- Schedule at(@) the date
- Reminder sinks down(-).
- Todo floats up(+).
- Deadline needs attention!
- Defer waves(~) up and down.
- Done is the end(.).

-------------------------------------

Think of this menu as a "modal dialog" rather than a
workspace. Typically, the commands listed in the menu apply to the
buffer BEHIND the menu, not the menu buffer itself. In other words,
they affect the buffer that was active before the menu appeared.

You can edit this menu itself.
>>> %Editing Menu%


= <<< %Editing Menu%
[Edit Menu] Hit RET on the left button to edit this menu.
[Update Menu] Hit RET on the left button to update this menu.
--------------------------------------------------------

Format of the menu file
(Please hit RET on [Edit Menu] and read the source file.)

== Basic format

As you see...

- [xxx] is button.
- %REMINDER (in small letters) is schedule and todo list.
- %RECENT (in small letters) is list of recent entries.
- %RANDOM (in small letters) is list of random entries.

You can arrange their places as you like.
Writing favorite files or goto links may be also convenient.
(ex) file:///etc/services   >>> wiki

== Shortcut

%"foo"[All]
This is displayed as foo[All], and the key "f" executes [All].
Exactly speaking, it executes the following sequence:
(1) move to closing ", (2) move to next underline, and (3) hit it.

%"bar%"
If you put % at the tail like this, the key "b" means "move cursor here".

== For lispers

Display:
%here%howm-congrats-count ;; embed value of variable howm-congrats-count
%here%(howm-menu-search "search")
;; embed result of (...), that is, search "search" and embed matched lines
Functions must be registered for safety.
(setq howm-menu-allow (append '(foo bar) howm-menu-allow)) ;; allow foo, bar

Action:
%eval%(message (buffer-name))  ;; evaluate S expr
%call%find-file  ;; call function interactively
Both are evaluated in the previous buffer before raising menu.

== Hiding

'%' + '|' toggles invisibility
like this: visible%|invisible%|appear%|disappear  - until the end of line
(Newline is removed when the end of line is invisible.)

== Multiple menus

Links to %xxx% open "<< < %xxx%" with menu-mode: >>> %menu%
When you add new menu, [[%menu%]] may be more convenient because corresponding
entry is generated automatically.

%eval%(howm-menu-open "00000000-000000.txt")  -- open file with menu-mode
