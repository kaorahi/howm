      --- You need to do nothing. :-)
 <li>(Case 1) I've set it in M-x customize-variable.
      --- M-x customize-variable howm-list-normalizer RET and select Off.
      Then M-x customize-variable howm-normalizer RET and select
      the corresponding item again.
 <li>(Case 2) I've written (setq howm-list-normalizer 'howm-view-sort-by-XXX)
      in my .emacs.
      --- Rewrite it to
      (setq howm-normalizer 'howm-sort-items-by-XXX).
 <li>(Case 3) I've written (setq howm-list-normalizer ...my_original_elisp...).
      --- Modify it correspondingly with the below change.
      <ul>
       <li>Old (howm-list-normalizer):
            Specify a function that sorts and REDISPLAYS CURRENT items.
       <li>New (howm-normalizer):
            Specify a function that RETURNS the sorted list of items
            for the GIVEN items.
      </ul>
